# Shopping cart

The main goal of this project was to practice react-router-dom and react testing library by building a shopping cart application. The setup was done with Vite and Vitest (for the testing framework).

# About

The app contains standard e-commerce store features using FakeStoreApi. Users can browse products, view detailed product info, add to cart, edit cart contents and simulate a mock checkout process.
